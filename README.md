# Marriage Success Predictor

I built a classification model which could be used to predict the likelihood of marriage success (or failure) based on several features.

## Background

This is my final project at Flatiron School (NYC Data Science).

The [Presentation] (https://github.com/davebletsch/Marriage_Success_Predictor/blob/master/presentation_marriage.pdf) shows the type of model, its performance, and the important features.

## Data

The data that I used for this project was a pre-made dataset on Kaggle, extracted from the 1994 Census bureau database. The initial 32,000+ data points were filtered to just over 20,000 relevant records for this model.

## In this repository

1. The [Preprocessing] (https://github.com/davebletsch/Marraige_Success_Predictor/blob/master/1-Preprocessing.ipynb) ipynb file contains the filtering process to keep relevant data for use in this project.
2. Further data cleaning and visualization is found in the [EDA] (https://github.com/davebletsch/Marraige_Success_Predictor/blob/master/EDA.ipynb) ipynb file.
3. Model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation can be found in the [Models] (https://github.com/davebletsch/Marraige_Success_Predictor/blob/master/Models.ipynb) ipynb file.
4. Final slide deck can be found in the .pptx file named [presentation_marriage] (https://github.com/davebletsch/Marriage_Success_Predictor/blob/master/presentation_marriage.pptx) and in the .pdf file named [presentation_marriage] (https://github.com/davebletsch/Marriage_Success_Predictor/blob/master/presentation_marriage.pdf)
